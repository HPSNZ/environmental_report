# HPSNZ Games Environmental Report
Preparing NSOs for Olympic venue climate using historical data

## Purpose
The HPSNZ Performance Physiology team strive to best prepare athletes, coaches and support staff for training and competition performance. 
An important aspect of their remit is sharing anunderstanding of the environmental conditions they will experience at the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Venue-specific and date-specific evidence is crucial in this performance preparation. Historical environmental and weather data from the Japanese Meteorological Agency can provide facts to inform campaigns.

## Data sources
The Japanese Meteorological Agency provides public historical weather observations from stations around the country. Measures of temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, etc are available for download from the website https://www.data.jma.go.jp/risk/obsdl/index.php.

## Background
Dr Julia Casadio created the first **Environmental Report** ahead of the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. A Tokyo 2020 version of the report was first written in 2018, and subsequently updated in 2019.

In lieu of the Tokyo 2020 Games (postponed due to the COVID-19 global pandemic), and at the time of writing, it is prudent to provide an update of 2020 conditions.

Attendees: Ben, Lauren, Lorenz

Tabled 2020 update report to be sent out to NSOs after Paralympic period in September. Purpose is to demonstrate '**what we would've experienced this year**' BUT FOR the COVID-19 global pandemic.

DECISIONS
- Aiming to align the Tokyo Venues Tableau Dashboard with the reported measures in the Environmental Report
- Change day counts (e.g. days temp > 30) to count *heat index* temperature
  1. No. Days >= 30
  2. No. Days >= 35
- Omit humidity measures; instead include *heat index* (to contextualise humidity)
- Include 2x visuals in this report update
  1. Day by day temp H and temp L for heritage zone and tokyo bay zone (with 1 week prior to Games period, 5 years prior)
  2. Within-day temp comparison, demonstrating fluctuations through the day (morning, afternoon, evening - do hourly median temps)
  
ACTIONS
- LS and LK to sketch draft visuals to aim for
- LS and LK to confirm no additional or changed venue locations
- BD to adjust analysis process to account for decisions made
