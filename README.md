## Background
Dr Julia Casadio created the first **Environmental Report** ahead of the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. A Tokyo 2020 version of the report was first written in 2018, and subsequently updated in 2019.

In lieu of the Tokyo 2020 Games (postponed due to the COVID-19 global pandemic), and at the time of writing, it is prudent to provide an update of 2020 conditions.
